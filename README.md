# Time-Series-Analysis
This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding Time Series Analysis.
Here I am doing Nosie checking and Filter the nosie uising Simple Moving Average .
For Noise Checking I am used Statistical Methods--<br>
Here is all steps are: 
The mean (𝜇) is calculated as: <br>
$$
\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
$$ <br> 
2. Calculate Standard Deviation (𝜎): -<br> 
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( x_i - \mu \right)^2}
$$
